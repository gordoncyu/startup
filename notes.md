# I Store my Notes Elsewhere in an Obsidian Vault
I already know markdown in its entirety, unless you count html as markdown.

# Anyway what I did for the HTML deliverable:
- Added dashboard page html in index.html, coding page for problems and problems submissions, and leaderboard page for viewing top scores per each problem.
- Used proper tags with header, body, and footer in each of the webpages, though did not use nav. Navigation is relatively simple; you start at the dashboard on index.html, go to a problem, then can go to a page for the scores for that problem. All these pages if you click on the name of the website at the top it will take you back to dashboard, just like any other website like youtube, etc.
- Links between three main pages where natural rather than nav
- Sufficient application text content for example 1337code problem, scores, and dashboard
- Button at botton of codepage for sharing solution with a qr code using external api
- image with 1337code logo
- login placeholder in page header
- db placeholder for leaderboard
- websocket placeholder for real-time thumbs up/down counter
